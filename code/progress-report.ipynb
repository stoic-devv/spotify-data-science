    "## About Data\n",
    "1. We have collected our data from multiple sources: Spotify and RateYourMusic. <br/>\n",
    "2. Spotify data consists of its metadata like name, genre, popularity and audio features like liveness, tempo, danceability, etc. <br/>\n",
    "3. RateYourMusic is a public forum where users review albums and songs. Its data consists of critic rating, user rating, reviews, and number of reviews.<br/>\n",
    "4. We have merged this data such that each entry has the song metadata, audio features, and ratings data. The ratings data will serve as a label and this is the reason we scraped data from multiple sites. <br/>\n",
    "5. The data is stored in csv format with a `~` separator.\n",
    "6. Link to our [dataset](https://github.com/stoic-devv/spotify-data-science/tree/main/data)."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Process\n",
    "1. Our approach was to first scrape the data from RYM as there was some uncertainity with it. Retrieving data from Spotify is straightforward with Python library `spotipy` which internally integrates with its well documented API.\n",
    "2. We have stored our data in csv format \n",
    "\n",
    "### How did collect your data\n",
    "1. We first explored libraries to scrape data: decided on [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) for Spotify and [rymparser](https://github.com/dbeley/rymscraper) for RateYourMusic.\n",
    "2. We scraped through the charts of top 20 albums each year from 1960-2021 over RYM. Collected features like reviews, ratings, number of reviews, genres, album name.\n",
    "3. Mapped the album name from RYM data to Spotify by using Spotify search APIs.\n",
    "4. Added more features relating to audio, quality and song metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How did you clean your data\n",
    "1. One advantage of scraping your own data is we can make cleaning part of the scraping process which is what we did. Since the data was in abundance we filtered out the tracks that has missing values. \n",
    "2. While combining the RYM with Spotify dataset we defined and used our own similarity metric wrt to the album titles when querying the Spotify APIs\n",
    "3. To have a good distribution of genres we deployed multiple metrics like: limiting the number of songs by a particular artist, taking the most popular songs from the rated albums.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mention any difficulties you faced in the beginning steps\n",
    "1. I had initially missed to check the `robots.txt` file over RYM which resulted in my IP ban on that site. I used VPN to bypass this ban.\n",
    "2. `beautifulsoup` also did not work over RYM due to the `robots.txt` configuration. We explored multiple projects over Github and finally found a [repository](https://github.com/dbeley/rymscraper) that used `selenium` which emulates your browsing by actually maintaining session within your browser to the website"

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After creating a correlation matrix, we found there are only a couple variables that have a strong correlation between each other. For example, acousticness and energy had a higher correlation of -.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Our preliminary EDA shows there is a strong bias, on the top 20 genres from Rate Your Music's community. The top 5 genres include Baroque Music, Film Score, Romanticism, Pop Rock, and Modern Classical would not be the top genres for other websites as these ratings depend on the community of rateyourmusic. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Looking at Pop Rock specifically over the years, there is a peak of pop rock genre songs in 1968. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The dataset comes from Rateyourmusic and Spotify. The rym rating is from Rateyourmusic and popularity is from Spotify. When comparing those metrics, there is an almost 0 correlation. From this, we can also say there is a huge bias from the Rateyourmusic's community, as Spotify is more telling of music metrics that is more mainstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Some methods we used to explore the data were bar graphs, a correlation matrix, and line plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Find our initial EDA [here](https://github.com/stoic-devv/spotify-data-science/blob/main/code/eda.ipynb). We plan to do more work on EDA since our most of our time was spent in data collection and cleaning."

    "2. Scraping and cleaning: We ran into various problems of installation, IP banning, and combining & cleaning data.\n",
    "3. We foresee a challenge to devise a metric that correlates the songs of different genres. User ratings for songs alone cannot serve as a metric for both recommending the best song and that too from a different genre"
